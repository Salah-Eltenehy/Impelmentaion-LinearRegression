Linear Regression...!

Linear regression is a statistical procedure for calculating the value of a dependent variable from an independent variable. 
Linear regression measures the association between two variables. 
It is a modeling technique where a dependent variable is predicted based on one or more independent variables. 
Linear regression analysis is the most widely used of all statistical techniques.
There are two ways for computing Linear Regression:
1-Gradient Descent.
2-Normal Equation.
You will find these ways in ML model.
